      Frustated by seeing too many papers omit the best performing methods,
      and inspired by [Hao Wooi Lim's blog](http://zybler.blogspot.de/2011/02/table-of-results-for-cifar-10-dataset.html),<br/>
      here you have a crowd sourced list of known result the "major" visual classification and detection datasets.
      
      You are most welcome to #{link_to "add new (or old) results", "new_result_form.html"}.

      Every entry on this page has been checked (once) by [me](http://rodrigob.github.com/#contact). 
      I might have made mistakes.<br/>
      Feel free to indicate any inacurracy in the listed data.
