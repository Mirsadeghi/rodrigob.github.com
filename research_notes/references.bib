	constraints, where there is partial knowledge about the environment
	and replanning is required. We present a new tree-based planner that
	explicitly deals with kinodynamic constraints and addresses the safety
	issues when planning under finite computation times, meaning that
	the vehicle avoids collisions in its evolving configuration space.
	In order to achieve good performance we incrementally update a tree
	data-structure by retaining information from previous steps and we
	bias the search of the planner with a greedy, yet probabilistically
	complete state space exploration strategy. Moreover, the number of
	collision checks required to guarantee safety is kept to a minimum.
	We compare our technique with alternative approaches as a standalone
	planner and show that it achieves favorable performance when planning
	with dynamics. We have applied the planner to solve a challenging
	replanning problem involving the mapping of an unknown workspace
	with a non-holonomic platform.},

  abstract = {This work deals with the problem of planning in real-time, collision-free
	motions for multiple communicating vehicles that operate in the same,
	partially-observable environment. A challenging aspect of this problem
	is how to utilize communication so that vehicles do not reach states
	from which collisions cannot be avoided due to second-order motion
	constraints. This paper provides a distributed communication protocol
	for real-time planning that guarantees collision avoidance with obstacles
	and between vehicles. It can also allow the retainment of a communication
	network when the vehicles operate as a networked team. The algorithm
	is a novel integration of sampling-based motion planners with message-passing
	protocols for distributed constraint optimization. Each vehicle uses
	the motion planner to generate candidate feasible trajectories and
	the message-passing protocol for selecting a safe and compatible
	trajectory. The existence of such trajectories is guaranteed by the
	overall approach. Experiments on a distributed simulator built on
	a cluster of processors confirm the safety properties of the approach
	in applications such as coordinated exploration. Furthermore, the
	distributed protocol has better scalability properties when compared
	against typical priority-based schemes.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a dynamic map for mobile robots that adapts
	continuously over time. It resolves the stability-plasticity dilemma
	(the trade-off between adaptation to new patterns and preservation
	of old patterns) by representing the environment over multiple timescales
	simultaneously (5 in our experiments). A sample-based representation
	is proposed, where older memories fade at different rates depending
	on the timescale. Robust statistics are used to interpret the samples.
	It is shown that this approach can track both stationary and non-stationary
	elements of the environment, covering the full spectrum of variations
	from moving objects to structural changes. The method was evaluated
	in a five week experiment in a real dynamic environment. Experimental
	results show that the resulting map is stable, improves its quality
	over time and adapts to changes.},

	a new method, based on the analysis of the error function being minimized.
	It considers that the correspondences are not independent (the same
	measurement being used in more than one correspondence), and explicitly
	utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, which are not
	assumed to be independent either. The validity of the approach is
	verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate than
	previous methods and its computational load is negligible. The ill-posedness
	of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled for under-constrained
	situations by performing an observability analysis; in the analyzed
	cases the method still provides a good estimate of the error projected
	on the observable manifold.},

	in this paper. The appealing feature of this method is that it directly
	uses the disparity images obtained from stereo matching. We assume
	that the stereo rig has parallel cameras and show, in that case,
	the geometric and topological properties of the disparity images.
	Then we introduce a rigid transformation (called d-motion) that maps
	two disparity images of a rigidly moving object. We show how it is
	related to the Euclidean rigid motion and a motion estimation algorithm
	is derived. We show with experiments that our approach is simple
	and more accurate than standard approaches},

	badly matched points. We show that, using a moving stereo rig, the
	detection of motion can be solved in a projective framework and therefore
	requires no camera calibration. Moreover the method allows for articulated
	objects. First we establish the projective framework enabling us
	to characterize rigid motion in projective space. This characterization
	is used in conjunction with a robust estimation technique to determine
	egomotion. Second we describe a method based on data classification
	which further considers the non-static scene points and groups them
	into several moving objects. Third we introduce a stereo-tracking
	algorithm that provides the point-topoint correspondences needed
	by the algorithms. Finally we show some experiments involving a moving
	stereo head observing both static and moving objects. 1.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a very efficient SLAM algorithm that works by
	hierarchically dividing the map into local regions and subregions.
	At each level of the hierarchy each region stores a matrix representing
	some of the landmarks contained in this region. For keeping the matrices
	small only those landmarks are represented being observable from
	outside the region. A measurement is integrated into a local subregion
	using $O(k^2)$ computation time for $k$ landmarks in a subregion.
	When the robot moves to a different subregion a global update is
	necessary requiring only $O(k^3 log n)$ computation time for $n$
	overall landmarks. The algorithm is evaluated for map quality, storage
	space and computation time using simulated and real experiments in
	an office environment.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous localisation and
	mapping (SLAM) by a mobile robot. An incremental SLAM algorithm is
	introduced that is derived from multigrid methods used for solving
	partial differential equations. The approach improves on the performance
	of previous relaxation methods for robot mapping because it optimizes
	the map at multiple levels of resolution. The resulting algorithm
	has an update time that is linear in the number of estimated features,
	even when closing very large loops, and offers advantages in handling
	non-linearities compared to other SLAM algorithms. Experimental comparisons
	with alternative algorithms using two well-known data sets and mapping
	results on a real robot are also presented.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a set of data processing algorithms for
	generating texture fa?ade meshes of cities from a series of vertical
	2D surface scans, obtained by a laser scanner while driving on public
	roads under normal traffic conditions. These processing steps are
	needed to cope with imperfections and non-idealities inherent in
	laser scanning systems such as occlusions and reflections from glass
	surfaces. The driven path is cut into easy-to-handle quasi-linear
	segments with approximately straight driving direction.The vertical
	scans in each segment are recorded in a sequential topological order,
	and are transformed into a depth image; if available, additional
	3D data from other modalities such as stereo vision is also taken
	into consideration. Dominant building structures are detected in
	the depth images, and points are classified into foreground and background
	layers. Large holes in the background layer, caused by occlusion
	from foreground layer objects, are filled in by planar or horizontal
	interpolation. The depth image is further processed by removing isolated
	points and filling remaining small holes, to obtain a textured surface
	mesh. We apply the above steps to a large set of data with several
	million 3D points, and show photorealistic texture mapped 3D models.},

  abstract = {The problem of generating maps with mobile robots has received considerable
	attention over the past years. However, most of the approaches focus
	on the problem of generating mostly consistent maps and assume that
	the environment is static during the data-acquisition phase. In this
	paper we consider the problem of creating maps with mobile robots
	in populated environments. Our approach uses a probabilistic approach
	to tracking multiple people and to incorporate the estimated positions
	of the people into the mapping process. The resulting maps are more
	accurate since corrupted readings treated accordingly during the
	matching phase and since the number of artificial objects in the
	resulting maps is reduced. Our approach has been implemented and
	tested on real robot systems in indoor and outdoor scenarios. We
	present several experiments illustrating the capabilities of our
	approach to generate accurate 2d and 3d maps.},

  abstract = {{This book gives senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students
	and researchers in computer vision, applied mathematics, computer
	graphics, and robotics a self-contained introduction to the geometry
	of 3D vision; that is the reconstruction of 3D models of objects
	from a collection of 2D images. Following a brief introduction, Part
	I provides background materials for the rest of the book. The two
	fundamental transformations, namely rigid body motion and perspective
	projection are introduced and image formation and feature extraction
	discussed. Part II covers the classic theory of two view geometry
	based on the so-called epipolar constraint. Part III shows that a
	more proper tool for studying the geometry of multiple views is the
	so- called rank considtion on the multiple view matrix. Part IV develops
	practical reconstruction algorithms step by step as well as discusses
	possible extensions of the theory. Exercises are provided at the
	end of each chapter. Software for examples and algorithms are available
	on the author's website.}},

	using sequential stereo images for visual navigation of an autonomous
	vehicle. The proposed method estimates 2-D projective transformations
	dynamically, which represent planes in space, for both stereo images
	and sequential images. This can be done robustly by utilizing sequential
	information, i.e. previous estimation of both the projective transformations
	and the corresponding planar region. In addition, a method for preventing
	misdetection due to textureless areas is proposed. The experimental
	results, using sequential stereo images taken from a moving vehicle,
	have shown that the proposed method can work robustly even in the
	conditions of undulation of the road and rolling and pitching of
	the vehicle.},

  title = {An Inevitable Collision State-Checker for a Car-Like Vehicle},
  booktitle = {IEEE Int. Conf. on Robotics and Automation},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {An Inevitable Collision State (ICS) for a robotic system is a state
	for which, no matter what the future trajectory followed by the system
	is, a collision with an obstacle eventually occurs. The ICS concept
	takes into account both the dynamics of the robotic system and the
	future motion of the moving objects of the environment. For obvious
	safety reasons, a robotic system should never ever end up in an ICS
	hence the interest of the ICS concept when it comes to safely drive
	robotic systems in dynamic environments. In theory, determining whether
	a given state is an ICS requires to check for collision all possible
	future trajectories of infinite duration that the robotic system
	can follow from this particular state! In practise, it is fortunately
	possible to build a conservative approximation of the ICS set by
	considering only a finite subset of the whole set of possible future
	trajectories. The primary contribution of the paper is a general
	principle to select the subset of trajectories based upon the concept
	of imitating manoeuvres, ie trajectories leading the robotic system
	to duplicate the behaviour of the environment objects (fixed or moving),
	it is shown how a good approximation of the ICS set can be obtained.
	The second contribution of the paper is an ICS-Checker for a car-like
	vehicle moving in a dynamic environment. This ICS-Checker integrates
	the above-mentioned selection principle. It is efficient and could
	be used in practise to compute truly safe motions for a car-like
	vehicle amidst moving objects.},

	is that a simple "one-vs-all" scheme is as accurate as any other
	approach, assuming that the underlying binary classifiers are well-tuned
	regularized classifiers such as support vector machines. This thesis
	is interesting in that it disagrees with a large body of recent published
	work on multiclass classification. We support our position by means
	of a critical review of the existing literature, a substantial collection
	of carefully controlled experimental work, and theoretical arguments.},

  abstract = {The ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm is widely used for geometric
	alignment of three-dimensional models when an initial estimate of
	the relative pose is known. Many variants of ICP have been proposed,
	affecting all phases of the algorithm from the selection and matching
	of points to the minimization strategy. We enumerate and classify
	many of these variants, and evaluate their effect on the speed with
	which the correct alignment is reached. In order to improve convergence
	for nearly-flat meshes with small features, such as inscribed surfaces,
	we introduce a new variant based on uniform sampling of the space
	of normals. We conclude by proposing a combination of ICP variants
	optimized for high speed. We demonstrate an implementation that is
	able to align two range images in a few tens of milliseconds, assuming
	a good initial guess. This capability has potential application to
	real-time 3D model acquisition and model-based tracking.},

  abstract = {Accurate detection of moving objects is an important precursor to
	stable tracking or recognition. In this paper, we present an object
	detection scheme that has three innovations over existing approaches.
	First, the model of the intensities of image pixels as independent
	random variables is challenged and it is asserted that useful correlation
	exists in intensities of spatially proximal pixels. This correlation
	is exploited to sustain high levels of detection accuracy in the
	presence of dynamic backgrounds. By using a nonparametric density
	estimation method over a joint domain-range representation of image
	pixels, multimodal spatial uncertainties and complex dependencies
	between the domain (location) and range (color) are directly modeled.
	We propose a model of the background as a single probability density.
	Second, temporal persistence is proposed as a detection criterion.
	Unlike previous approaches to object detection which detect objects
	by building adaptive models of the background, the foregrounds modeled
	to augment the detection of objects (without explicit tracking) since
	objects detected in the preceding frame contain substantial evidence
	for detection in the current frame. Finally, the background and foreground
	models are used competitively in a MAP-MRF decision framework, stressing
	spatial context as a condition of detecting interesting objects and
	the posterior function is maximized efficiently by finding the minimum
	cut of a capacitated graph. Experimental validation of the proposed
	method is performed and presented on a diverse set of dynamic scenes.},

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This paper addresses the problem of factorization-based
	3D reconstruction from uncalibrated image sequences. Previous studies
	on structure and motion factorization are either based on simplified
	affine assumption or general perspective projection. The affine approximation
	is widely adopted due to its simplicity, whereas the extension to
	perspective model suffers from recovering projective depths. To fill
	the gap between simplicity of affine and accuracy of perspective
	model, we propose a quasi-perspective projection model for structure
	and motion recovery of rigid and nonrigid objects based on factorization
	framework. The novelty and contribution of this paper are as follows.
	Firstly, under the assumption that the camera is far away from the
	object with small lateral rotations, we prove that the imaging process
	can be modeled by quasi-perspective projection, which is more accurate
	than affine model from both geometrical error analysis and experimental
	studies. Secondly, we apply the model to establish a framework of
	rigid and nonrigid factorization under quasi-perspective assumption.
	Finally, we propose an Extended Cholesky Decomposition to recover
	the rotation part of the Euclidean upgrading matrix. We also prove
	that the last column of the upgrading matrix corresponds to a global
	scale and translation of the camera thus may be set freely. The proposed
	method is validated and evaluated extensively on synthetic and real
	image sequences and improved results over existing schemes are observed.},
